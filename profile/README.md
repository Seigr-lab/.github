# Welcome to Seigr-lab

**Seigr-lab** is dedicated to pioneering sustainable, decentralized data ecosystems inspired by biomimicry and eco-conscious principles. By developing tools that emphasize resilience, modularity, and transparency, Seigr-lab is redefining the intersection of technology and nature.

## What is Seigr?

Seigr is our flagship ecosystem, integrating decentralized data management, adaptive protocols, and regenerative computing inspired by natural systems like mycelium networks. Our primary project, **Seigr-EcoSystem**, showcases the potential of sustainable, distributed data networks and sets the foundation for a new era of eco-friendly computing.

### Key Principles

* **Sustainability**: Minimize resource consumption through energy-efficient design and senary encoding.
* **Resilience**: Adaptive self-healing and secure, distributed systems that echo the stability of natural ecosystems.
* **Transparency**: Open-source collaboration with community-driven governance and clear data lineage tracking.
* **Modularity**: A flexible framework that allows easy integration, scaling, and adaptation to emerging technologies.

## Main Projects

### [Seigr-EcoSystem](https://github.com/Seigr-lab/Seigr-EcoSystem) (WIP: will remain private until fully developed)

A biomimetic data management framework that supports eco-conscious encoding, secure capsule-based data storage, and adaptive network intelligence. The Seigr-EcoSystem is the foundation for decentralized, sustainable digital applications.

### [Seigr Toolset Crypto (STC)](https://github.com/Seigr-lab/SeigrToolsetCrypto)

The first official tool of the **Seigr Toolset**, STC is a **post-classical, entropy-regenerative cryptographic engine** designed for binary-world applications.

* Rejects legacy symmetric/asymmetric cryptography, XOR, and static substitution.
* Uses **Continuous Entropy Lattices (CEL)**, **Contextual Key Emergence (CKE)**, **Probabilistic Hashing (PHE)**, **Data-State Folding (DSF)**, and **Polymorphic Cryptographic Flow (PCF)** for fully dynamic, deterministic, and context-sensitive encryption.
* Provides both Python API and CLI for secure credential management, encrypted configuration, and data integrity verification.
* Fully open-source, installable, and ready to integrate into existing or future Seigr Toolset projects.
